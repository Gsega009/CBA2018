<p><strong>8.0 Giddy-Up-PC Warranties</strong></p>
<p>8.1 If we cannot provide you with a solution to your problem, we will not charge you for those services in respect of that problem. In some cases, the solution may be that you need to upgrade or replace your software or hardware. If we advise you to do so and you choose not to upgrade or replace your software or hardware, you acknowledge that we have met our commitment to you by providing you with a solution to your problem, whether or not you choose to implement that solution.<br />

8.3 You acknowledge that computers are complicated and sometimes problems are more deeply rooted or complicated than initially diagnosed. You also acknowledge that a problem which occurs with your computer after our visit may be unrelated to the work we performed for you and is therefore outside the scope of our Service Guarantee.<br />

You also acknowledge that your use of such software may be subject to a third party licence.<br />
8.6 We shall honour all terms, conditions and obligations (if any) that are implied or imposed under applicable State or Commonwealth laws concerning the supply of the goods and/or the performance of the services and nothing in these Conditions seeks to restrict, modify, limit or exclude such terms, conditions or obligations.
